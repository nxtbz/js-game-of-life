# Conway's Game of Life in Javascript
JavaScript implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). A generation is
represented by a 2-dimensional array of booleans. Every step of the simulation a new 2-dimensional
array is created without modifying the current one.

Press any key to start the simulation. 'C' to clear the board, 'R' for a random generation, or use
the mouse to change the board.

Tested with Chrome and Safari on macOS.
